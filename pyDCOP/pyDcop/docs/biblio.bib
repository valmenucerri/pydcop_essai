To approach real-world efficiency requirements, we obtain immense speedups by improving communication structure and precomputing best case bounds. Heuristics for generating better communication structures and calculating bound in a distributed manner are provided and tested on systematically developed domains for meeting scheduling and sensor networks, exemplifying the viability of complete algorithms. 1.},

To cope with limited computational resources and restricted real-time requirement, it is imperative to apply distributed algorithms that have low overhead on resource requirement and high anytime performance. In this paper, We study distributed stochastic algorithm (DSA) and distributed breakout algorithm (DBA), two distributed algorithms developed earlier for distributed constraint satisfaction problems. We experimentally investigate their properties and compare their performance using our distributed scheduling problem as a benchmark. We first formulate the scheduling problem as a distributed multi-coloring problem. We then experimentally show that the solution quality and communication cost of DSA exhibit phase-transition or threshold behavior, in that the performance degenerates abruptly and dramatically when the degree of parallel executions of distributed agents increases beyond some critical value. The results show that when controlled properly, DSA is superior to DBA, having better or competitive solution quality and significantly smaller communication cost than DBA. Therefore, DSA is the algorithm of choice for our distributed scan scheduling problem.},

	abstract = {In the context of solving large distributed constraint optimization problems ({DCOP}), belief-propagation and approximate inference algorithms are candidates of choice. However, in general, when the factor graph is very loopy (i.e. cyclic), these solution methods suﬀer from bad performance, due to non-convergence and many exchanged messages. As to improve performances of the Max-Sum inference algorithm when solving loopy constraint optimization problems, we propose here to take inspiration from the belief-propagation-guided decimation used to solve sparse random graphs (k-satisﬁability). We propose the novel D M S method, which is parameterized in terms of policies to decide when to trigger decimation, which variables to decimate, and which values to assign to decimated variables. Based on an empirical evaluation on a classical {BP} benchmark (the Ising model), some of these combinations of policies exhibit better performance than state-of-the-art competitors.},

In this paper, we show how to extend the algorithm to arbitrary topologies using cycle cutsets, while preserving the linear message size and memory requirements. We present some preliminary experimental results on randomly generated problems. The algorithm is formulated for optimization problems, but can be easily applied to satisfaction problems as well.},

  abstract = {Many problems in multi-agent systems can be described as distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems (distributed CSPs), where the goal is to nd a set of assignments to variables that satis es all constraints among agents. However, when real problems are formalized as distributed CSPs, they are often over-constrained and have no solution that satis es all constraints. This paper provides the Distributed Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problem (DPCSP) as a new framework for dealing with over-constrained situations. We also present new algorithms for solving Distributed Maximal Constraint Satisfaction Problems (DMCSPs), which belong to an important class of DPCSP. The algorithms are called the Synchronous Branch and Bound (SBB) and the Iterative Distributed Breakout (IDB). Both algorithms were tested on hard classes of over-constrained random binary distributed CSPs. The results can be summarized as SBB is preferable when we are mainly concerned with the optimality of a solution, while IDB is preferable when we want to get a nearly optimal solution quickly.},
